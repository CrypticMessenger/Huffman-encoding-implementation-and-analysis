Yudkowsky always speaks, and there’s usually an ethicist or two as well as
spokespeople for the extropian and transhuman communities. Extropians
explore technologies and therapies that will permit humans to live forever.
Transhumans think about hardware and cosmetic ways for increasing human
capability, beauty, and … opportunities to live forever. Standing astride all
the factions is the Colossus of the Singularity, a cofounder of the Singularity
Summits, and the star of each gathering, Ray Kurzweil.
The 2011 summit’s theme was IBM’s DeepQA (question answering)
computer Watson, and Kurzweil gave a rote presentation on the history of
chatbots and Q&A systems, entitled “From Eliza to Watson.” But midtalk he
came to life to gut a maladroit essay coauthored by Microsoft cofounder Paul
Allen, attacking his Singularity hypothesis.
Kurzweil didn’t look particularly well—thin, a little halting, quieter than
usual. He’s not the kind of speaker who eats up the stage or delivers zingers.
To the contrary, he’s got a mild, robotic delivery, the kind that seems
designed for hostage negotiations or bedtime stories. But it plays well
against the casually revolutionary things he has to say. In an age when billionaires give presentations in pressed jeans, Kurzweil is wearing
your uncle’s brown slacks, along with tasseled loafers, sports jacket, and
glasses. He’s neither large nor small, but recently has started looking old,
especially in comparison to the vigorous Kurzweil of my memory. He had
been a mere fifty-two or so when I last interviewed him, and hadn’t yet
started the intense calorie restriction diet that’s now part of his plan to slow
his aging. With a fine-tuned regimen of diet, exercise, and supplements,
Kurzweil plans to fend off death until technology finds the cure he’s certain
will come.
