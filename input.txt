God, I remember the days of January 2020. Those days seem much better to the present condition. I don't know what will happen to other humans and me, but I am writing this to ensure future humans see it and gain more knowledge about what's happening right now so that they don't repeat the mistakes done by us.
Okay, so China is finally a superpower. It crashed the USA's markets with a single malware attack after the USA tried to stop it from invading small nations.UN, WHO, etc. They are in china's pocket now. The USA was at war with China along with a withcrashed economy. India and Russia(surprisingly yes) came forward to help, but anarchy was at its peak in the USA.
So to the point, the war became dirty! With malware attacks, china didn't just destroy US markets, but some of the most advanced US technologies as AI were damaged by the malware attack. To counter this USA did a strike of 2 nuclear bombs and thousands of chemical bombs, causing casualty of 700 million people.China didn't tolerate it and replied USA with a "BIOLOGICAL WEAPON".
Yes, here we are suffering from a biological weapon.I named it as Des2050.it's a crypto-Fungirus(fungi+virus).with ability to mutate fast and spread fast.
It's symptoms are not clear but its a zombie virus,okay so this isn't a science fiction,this is happening with us,right now.
Only 23 confirmed cases are found to exist until now worldwide with 21 alone in USA,1 in India and 1 in Russia.you won't be surprised that WHO/UN is doing nothing.
I am in India. Maybe you can call it too early, but i decide to record the events because i knew how covid19 spreaded back then,not going to make the same mistake of ignoring the fact that tis is even more dangerous as it's a "biologicall weapon."
China claims that it is free of the virus. Still, I knew it(from a top-secret resource on the dark web) that it isn't.you may question china must have the cure...No, it hasn't,with two nuclear weapons launched, china considered establishing an "operation wipe out" rather than replying with more nuclear weapons. China's reply with nuclear weapon meant slow painful extinction of the blue dot,but this virus is still better than nuclear apocalypse,trust me.earth would be barren for millions of years if nuclear weapon would have been launched atleast this virus still gives a chance to undo the damage caused
