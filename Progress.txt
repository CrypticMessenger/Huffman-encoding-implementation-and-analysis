26-10-21:
  Implemented input/output mechanism using file handling.
  Implemented frequency counter function, which stores the data in an array.
  
  TODO for next sesion: 
    Research about a better alternative of huffman trees, and think about implementing it if time allows(time will allow it most certainly).
    Convert all cpp files into C files at last.
    think about storing data using hashing(or maybe implimenting a map in C )
    add comments for better navigation

02-11-21:
  -> Started making heaps, and basic sorting using O(n^2) (implemented), need to be optimised.
  -> defined basic structs .
  
  TODO for session:
    start implementing huffman algorithm.
    
    members present: Ankit, Amit; (Tanish absent, because he was at home. )

06-11-21:
  -> started making huffman trees, but got struck in some segmentation fault.
  ->TODO:
    ->recheck fault.
    ->solve the bug.
    ->make huffman trees.

    members present: Ankit, Amit; (Tanish absent)

07-11-21:
  ->used debugger to pin point segmentation fault, and resolved it successfully.
  -> implemented algorithm to make huffman trees, by slightly modifying the previous algorithm.

  ->TODO:
    ->implement huffman traversal encoding.
    members present: Ankit, Amit; (Tanish absent, because he was travelling for past 5 days.)

08-11-21:
  ->tried implementing traversal encoding, but failed. will see it later.

09-11-21:
  ->changed the way we were storing encodings, but still failed. (thought about storing them in structs).

10-11-21:
  ->slight improvement , but still failed. (storing them in structs).

12-11-21:
  -> totally changed the way we were storing encodings, Finally Success. (storing them in arrays like map).
  
13-11-21:
   ->TODO: start report writing.
   ->ask doubt about compression and research some more.
   ->start adding comments.
   
   DONE: checked output compressed(supposedly) file. not compressed actually. (we output it as .txt which is wrong.)
