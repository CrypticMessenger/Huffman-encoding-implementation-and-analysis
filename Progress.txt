  Implemented input/output mechanism using file handling.
  Implemented frequency counter function, which stores the data in an array.
  
  TODO for next sesion: 
    Research about a better alternative of huffman trees, and think about implementing it if time allows(time will allow it most certainly).
    Convert all cpp files into C files at last.
