Instructions to run the program:
 -We have used gcc compiler to compile the program.
 -Enter the text that you want to compress in to input.txt file.
 -For making new node that need to store only frequnecy, we have added "NULL" character at that node.
 -If you want to test our code by giving input to a character and it's frequency, then you can do it by using testBench.cpp .
   Using this it will generate a text from that set of characters and compress it.
 -Just by running it,it will output characters and corresponding frequencies in the text, then it will print encoding of each character, 
   finally the compressed version of the text will be outputed in output.txt file which consists of bits(0 and 1).
 -We have shown that our text got compressed by calculating the compression ratio which is ratio of (initial file size)/(final file size) which comes out to be >1.
